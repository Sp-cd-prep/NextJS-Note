## ‚úÖ Why **Next.js** is a Powerful Extension of **React**

Think of **React** as the engine that powers your car (it helps you build UI components).
But **Next.js** is the **fully assembled car** ‚Äî ready to drive, complete with a body, seats, wheels, navigation system, and much more.

Next.js **extends** React by solving the **real-world problems** developers face when building production-grade web apps with React alone.

### üîç React Alone: What‚Äôs Missing?

React is powerful, but it only helps with:

* Component-based UI building (JSX)
* Declarative state and props handling
* Client-side rendering (CSR)

But when you're making a **full-fledged application**, you face questions like:

| Problem                | React Alone                                  |
| ---------------------- | -------------------------------------------- |
| Routing                | You need `react-router-dom` manually         |
| SEO                    | Poor (CSR only; no meta tags in HTML source) |
| Performance            | Slow initial load for large apps             |
| Code Splitting         | Needs manual configuration                   |
| Server-side rendering  | Not built-in                                 |
| File structure/routing | You must design from scratch                 |
| Image optimization     | You manage yourself                          |
| API building           | You need to set up Express or something else |

# Next.js Overview and Prerequisites

**Next.js** is a React-based framework for building full-stack web apps.  It adds powerful features (file-based routing, hybrid rendering, optimized bundling) on top of React so you can focus on building your app.  Under the hood it configures tools for you (webpack, Babel, etc.) so you spend less time on setup.  By using Next.js, your React app can pre-render pages on the server or at build time, which makes it faster and SEO-friendly.

* **Key features:** File-system routing (each file in `pages/` is a route); built-in data fetching methods; hybrid rendering (Static Generation and Server-Side Rendering); optimized code-splitting, images and font handling; and easy deployment. Next.js even handles things like development/production differences and supports hot-reloading (Fast Refresh) out of the box.
* **Why use Next.js?** It lets you choose per-page whether to pre-render content at build time (Static Generation) or on each request (SSR). Static Generation (pre-render at build time) makes pages load very fast and can be served from a CDN. SSR (Server-Side Rendering) regenerates a page on every request, which is useful for dynamic or user-specific content. You can even mix these strategies in one app. In short, Next.js gives you the power and flexibility of React plus production-ready features like routing and server-side logic.

**Prerequisites:** You should already know basic HTML, CSS and React (components, JSX).  Knowledge of JavaScript (ES6+) and the Node.js/npm ecosystem is important since Next.js runs on Node.  (If you need a React refresher, see the official [React tutorial](https://react.dev/learn/).)  With those in hand, you can follow the steps below to start a Next.js project.

## Setting Up Your First Next.js App

1. **Install Node.js (v18+).** Next.js requires Node.js version 18 or higher.  If you don‚Äôt have it, download it from [nodejs.org](https://nodejs.org/).
2. **Create a Next.js project.** In your terminal, navigate to the folder where you want the project and run:

   ```bash
   npx create-next-app@latest my-next-app
   ```

   This `create-next-app` command bootstraps a new Next.js app (using the latest Next.js version).  You can give your project any name (`my-next-app` above).  It will ask a few questions (e.g. if you want TypeScript; since we‚Äôre focusing on JavaScript, you can skip that).  The tool sets up a folder (`my-next-app`) with the default template.
3. **Run the development server.** After creation, change into the project directory and start the dev server:

   ```bash
   cd my-next-app
   npm run dev
   ```

   This launches the Next.js development server on `http://localhost:3000`.  Open that URL in your browser: you should see the default Next.js welcome page. You now have a working Next.js environment.

**Project structure:** By default, Next.js creates a few folders/files:

* `pages/`: This is where you put React components for each page/route of your site. For example, `pages/index.js` will be the homepage (`/`), and `pages/about.js` would serve `/about`.
* `public/`: Static assets (images, etc.) live here.
* `styles/`: CSS or module files for styling (though you can use any CSS-in-JS or framework you like).
* `package.json`, `next.config.js` etc.: Standard Node project files.

You can open the project in your editor and explore. In `pages/index.js` you‚Äôll see a default page component. You can edit it and see changes live.

## Pages and File-based Routing

Next.js uses **file-based routing**. Each file you put under the `pages/` directory becomes a route in your app:

* `pages/index.js` ‚Üí route `/` (the homepage).
* `pages/about.js` ‚Üí route `/about`.
* `pages/blog/hello.js` ‚Üí route `/blog/hello`.
* **Index routes:** Any `index.js` in a folder maps to the folder‚Äôs root. E.g. `pages/blog/index.js` maps to `/blog`.
* **Dynamic routes:** You can create dynamic URL parameters by bracket syntax. For example, a file named `pages/posts/[id].js` will match `/posts/1`, `/posts/hello-world`, etc. (You use `getStaticPaths` with this for static generation; we‚Äôll cover dynamic routing later.).

**Example:** Suppose we create `pages/about.js`:

```js
// pages/about.js
export default function About() {
  return <h1>About Us</h1>;
}
```

When running the app, navigating to `http://localhost:3000/about` shows ‚ÄúAbout Us‚Äù.  The name of the file (without extension) defines the route path.

**Layouts:** If you have a common layout (header/footer) across pages, you can create a custom `<App>` in `pages/_app.js` that wraps every page. For instance:

```js
// pages/_app.js
import Layout from '../components/Layout';
export default function MyApp({ Component, pageProps }) {
  return (
    <Layout>
      <Component {...pageProps} />
    </Layout>
  );
}
```

This wraps every page with `<Layout>`. We won‚Äôt dive into layouts deeply right now, but know that `_app.js` is where app-wide wrappers belong. (For now, focus on individual pages and routing.)

## Client-Side Navigation with Link

Next.js provides a built-in `<Link>` component for navigation. Unlike a normal `<a>` tag, `<Link>` performs **client-side transitions** between pages (no full page reload). This makes navigation fast and feels like a single-page app.

&#x20;*Figure: Example of navigating between pages with `<Link>` (the **Link** component lets you click through pages without a full reload).*

To use `<Link>`, import it from `next/link` and set its `href` to the path you want:

```js
import Link from 'next/link';

export default function HomePage() {
  return (
    <div>
      <h1>Welcome!</h1>
      <Link href="/about">Go to About page</Link>
    </div>
  );
}
```

Here, clicking ‚ÄúGo to About page‚Äù will take you to `/about`. Under the hood, Next.js preloads linked pages for an ultra-fast transition. You can nest any elements inside `<Link>`; e.g. `<Link href="/posts/first-post">First Post</Link>`. (In Next.js 12.2 and later, you no longer need to put an `<a>` tag inside `<Link>` ‚Äì you can have it wrap text or elements directly.)

Example from the docs:

```js
// pages/posts/first-post.js
import Link from 'next/link';

export default function FirstPost() {
  return (
    <>
      <h1>First Post</h1>
      <p>This is my first post.</p>
      <Link href="/">‚Üê Back to home</Link>
    </>
  );
}
```

In this code, the `<Link href="/">` navigates back to the home page. When building your app, add such links between pages to allow easy navigation. The Next.js Link component ensures pages load without a full refresh.

## Data Fetching: Static Generation vs Server-Side Rendering

A core feature of Next.js is **pre-rendering** pages to HTML before serving them, which improves performance and SEO. You can choose between:

* **Static Generation (SSG):** The page HTML is generated *at build time*. Next.js runs your code once when you build, fetches any data, and produces a static HTML file. That file is reused for every request. This is extremely fast (served by CDN). It‚Äôs ideal for content that doesn‚Äôt change on every request (e.g. blog posts, marketing pages). If the page needs data, you use `getStaticProps()` in your page component.
* **Server-Side Rendering (SSR):** The page HTML is generated *on each request*. Next.js runs your code on the server every time someone hits that URL. This ensures data is always fresh (great for user-specific or frequently updated data). The trade-off is each request takes longer (slightly slower TTFB) since the page is rendered on the fly. For SSR, you export `getServerSideProps()` from your page.

> **‚ÄúNext.js has two forms of pre-rendering: Static Generation and Server-side Rendering. The difference is in when it generates the HTML.‚Äù**. Static Generation creates the HTML at **build time**, while SSR does it **on each request**. Next.js lets you choose per-page which method to use (you can even mix them in one app).

**Static Generation example:** In a page file (e.g. `pages/index.js`), you can export an async function `getStaticProps`. This function runs at *build time* and returns data as props to your page component. For example:

```js
export default function HomePage({ posts }) {
  return (
    <ul>
      {posts.map(post => (
        <li key={post.id}>{post.title}</li>
      ))}
    </ul>
  );
}

export async function getStaticProps() {
  // This code runs at build time on the server
  const posts = [
    { id: 'post1', title: 'My First Post' },
    { id: 'post2', title: 'Another Post' },
  ];
  return { props: { posts } };
}
```

When you build the app, Next.js calls `getStaticProps`, gets the `posts` data, and generates the HTML for `HomePage`. At runtime, it serves that pre-built HTML to every visitor. The `posts` prop is passed into the component (as indicated by `return { props: { posts } }`), and you can use it just like any React prop. The docs note: **‚ÄúgetStaticProps will pre-render a page at build time using the props returned from the function‚Äù**. In our example, the static HTML will list the two posts.

You can also fetch from an API or database inside `getStaticProps`, and Next.js will include that data. *Importantly*, code in `getStaticProps` runs only on the server (build server), so you can safely use Node APIs or secret keys there. (Any modules you import at top-level of the file won‚Äôt be sent to the browser.)

Next.js supports **Incremental Static Regeneration (ISR)**: you can tell Next.js to re-generate a static page periodically (with the `revalidate` option) so your static content stays updated without a full rebuild. See [Next.js ISR docs](https://nextjs.org/docs/basic-features/data-fetching/incremental-static-regeneration) for details.

**Server-Side Rendering example:** If your page needs up-to-the-minute data (for example, user-specific content or live data), use `getServerSideProps`. For example:

```js
export default function Dashboard({ stats }) {
  return <div>Current users: {stats.users}</div>;
}

export async function getServerSideProps() {
  // Runs on every request
  const res = await fetch('https://api.example.com/stats');
  const stats = await res.json();
  return { props: { stats } };
}
```

Here, each time someone visits `/dashboard`, Next.js runs `getServerSideProps` to fetch new data and then renders the page. The data (`stats`) is passed as props to the component. The docs explain: **‚ÄúgetServerSideProps is a Next.js function that can be used to fetch data and render the contents of a page at request time.‚Äù**. In SSR, there is no build-time HTML ‚Äì the HTML is generated on demand.

**When to use which:** Use **Static Generation** whenever possible for performance (ideal for public pages, blogs, docs). Use **Server-side Rendering** for data that changes per request or requires secrecy (like auth tokens). The Vercel blog notes: *‚ÄúStatic Generation is more performant‚Ä¶ but data could become stale. You can work around this with ISR or client-side fetching‚Äù*.

## React Props and State in Next.js Components

Since Next.js pages are just React components, all the usual React principles apply. You can use **props** to pass data into components, and **state** (via `useState`) for dynamic interactivity.

* **Props:** Data returned from `getStaticProps` or `getServerSideProps` is passed into your page component as props. But even without data fetching, you can create child components and pass props down. *Props* are simply how React components receive input. As React docs say: *‚ÄúReact components use props to communicate with each other. Every parent component can pass some information to its child components by giving them props.‚Äù*. Think of props like function arguments. For example:

  ```js
  function Avatar({ person, size }) { ‚Ä¶ } 
  function Profile() {
    const user = { name: 'Alice', img: '...' };
    return <Avatar person={user} size={100} />;
  }
  ```

  Here `Profile` passes a `person` object and `size` number as props to `Avatar`.

* **State:** When a component needs to remember information and react to user input, you use React state. Next.js pages can use state just like any React component. The simplest way is the `useState` hook. The React docs explain: *‚ÄúComponents often need to change what‚Äôs on the screen as a result of an interaction‚Ä¶ this kind of component-specific memory is called state.‚Äù*. For example, you might do:

  ```js
  import { useState } from 'react';

  export default function Counter() {
    const [count, setCount] = useState(0);
    return (
      <>
        <p>Count: {count}</p>
        <button onClick={() => setCount(count + 1)}>Increment</button>
      </>
    );
  }
  ```

  Here `count` is a state variable initialized to `0`, and `setCount` is the function that updates it. When `setCount` is called, React re-renders the component with the new count. In short, **state lets a component ‚Äúremember‚Äù data between renders and update the UI when it changes**.

In a Next.js page, you can freely mix props from data fetching with local state. For example:

```js
export default function Greeting({ initialName }) {
  const [name, setName] = useState(initialName || 'Guest');
  return (
    <>
      <p>Hello, {name}!</p>
      <button onClick={() => setName('Alice')}>Set Name to Alice</button>
    </>
  );
}

// getStaticProps could provide initialName from some API:
export async function getStaticProps() {
  return { props: { initialName: 'Bob' } };
}
```

The `name` state starts as `'Bob'` (from props), and clicking the button changes it to `'Alice'`.

**Summary:** Next.js pages are normal React components, so you use props and state exactly as you would in React. Props (from parent components or from data fetching) are read-only inputs, and state (`useState`, etc.) is for interactive, changeable data inside the component.

## Building a Simple Example

To tie these concepts together, let‚Äôs sketch a simple example. Imagine a page that lists blog posts (using static generation) and links to a detail page:

1. **Create some data or markdown:** For simplicity, we‚Äôll hardcode an array in `getStaticProps`.

2. **Index page (`pages/index.js`):** This page will list posts.

   ```js
   // pages/index.js
   import Link from 'next/link';

   export default function Home({ posts }) {
     return (
       <div>
         <h1>Blog Posts</h1>
         <ul>
           {posts.map(post => (
             <li key={post.id}>
               <Link href={`/posts/${post.id}`}>{post.title}</Link>
             </li>
           ))}
         </ul>
       </div>
     );
   }

   export async function getStaticProps() {
     // Simulate fetching or reading posts
     const posts = [
       { id: 'hello-world', title: 'Hello World' },
       { id: 'nextjs-guide', title: 'Learning Next.js' },
     ];
     return { props: { posts } };
   }
   ```

   This uses `getStaticProps` to supply a `posts` array. The component maps over `posts` and renders links to `/posts/hello-world` and `/posts/nextjs-guide`. Because of static generation, this HTML is generated at build time.

3. **Post detail page (`pages/posts/[id].js`):** A dynamic route file. You‚Äôd use `getStaticPaths` + `getStaticProps` here (beyond our Unit1 scope), but as a placeholder:

   ```js
   // pages/posts/[id].js
   import { useRouter } from 'next/router';

   export default function PostPage() {
     const router = useRouter();
     const { id } = router.query;  // e.g. 'hello-world'
     return <h1>Post: {id}</h1>;
   }
   ```

   In a full example, you‚Äôd fetch or read the post content based on `id`. For now, we demonstrate routing: clicking a link on the home page will bring you here, and `id` comes from the URL.

4. **Running it:** Start the dev server (`npm run dev`) and go to `http://localhost:3000`. You should see the list of posts with links. Clicking a link navigates to, e.g., `/posts/hello-world` (client-side via `<Link>`) and shows ‚ÄúPost: hello-world‚Äù.

Through this mini-app, we used **file-based routing** (`pages/index.js` and `pages/posts/[id].js`), **Link** for client navigation, **getStaticProps** for static data, and React **props** to pass data into the component. This covers the Unit1 concepts of routing, props, and basic data fetching.

## Summary of Unit1 Topics

* **Next.js 15 (Latest)** is a React framework for building performant web apps.
* **Prerequisites:** HTML, CSS, React, Node/npm.
* **Creating an App:** Use `npx create-next-app@latest` to scaffold; start with `npm run dev`.
* **Pages/Routes:** Any JS file in `pages/` is a route (file-system routing). Dynamic routes use `[param].js`.
* **Navigation:** Use `<Link href="/path">` from `next/link` for fast client-side navigation.
* **Data Fetching:** Two main modes ‚Äì **Static Generation** with `getStaticProps` (build-time), and **Server-Side Rendering** with `getServerSideProps` (run on each request). Static is faster (HTML cached/CDN) but data may be stale; SSR is always fresh but slower per request.
* **Props and State:** Next pages are React components, so use props to pass data (e.g. from `getStaticProps`), and use `useState` to manage local state for interactive behavior.

**Next Steps:** In the next lectures, you‚Äôll dive deeper into topics like dynamic routes with `getStaticPaths`, API routes, advanced data fetching (ISR, on-demand revalidation), and the newer App Router. But with this foundation you can already build basic multi-page Next.js apps that use static generation and client-side navigation.

**Resources:** See the official Next.js docs for more detail, especially **‚ÄúGetting Started‚Äù** and **‚ÄúBasic Features‚Äù** sections. The Learn Next.js tutorial (from Vercel) is also helpful for step-by-step chapters. The above citations are from the official docs and related guides to ensure accuracy.
